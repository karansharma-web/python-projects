"""
The Next Palindrome

Problem Statement
A palindrome is a string which when reversed is equal to itself:
Examples of palindrome includes 616, mom, 676, 100001
You have to take a number as an input from the user. You have to find the next palindrome to that number.
Your first input should be ‘number of test cases’ and then take all the cases as input from the user
Input:
3
451
10
2133
Output:
Next palindrome for 451 is 454
Next palindrome for 10 is 11
Next palindrome for 2133 is 2222
